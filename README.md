# heroes-list-vue3

#### I made this project as a part of the learning of Vue 3.In this project I made a simple application to create a DC Heroes List

#### I tried to figure out these kind of concepts;

How can we work with new Vue3 ? then i use v-for,v-bind,v-if, I clearly understood the differences between v-if and v-show and applied it to the project.
 I understood the differences between computed property and methods by experimenting on the project.
